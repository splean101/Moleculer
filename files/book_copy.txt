Introductory fragment, copying is prohibitedI.Â The river bank


The Mole had been working very hard all the morning, spring-cleaning his little home. First with brooms, then with 2dusters; then on ladders and steps and chairs, with a brush and a pail of whitewash; till he had dust in his throat and eyes, and splashes of whitewash all over his black fur, and an aching back and weary arms. Spring was moving in the air above and in the earth below and around him, penetrating even his dark and lowly little house with its spirit of divine discontent and longing. It was small wonder, then, that he suddenly flung down his brush on the floor, said Â«Bother!Â» and Â«O blow!Â» and also Â«Hang spring-cleaning!Â» and bolted out of the house without even waiting to put on his coat[1 - It was small wonder, then, that he suddenly flung down his brush on the floor, said Â«Bother!Â» and Â«O blow!Â» and also Â«Hang spring-cleaning!Â» and bolted out of the house without even waiting to put on his coat. Something up above was calling him imperiously, and he made for tIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedhe steep little tunnel which answered in his case to the gravelled carriage-drive owned by animals whose residences are nearer to the sun and air. So he scraped and scratched and scrabbled and scrooged and then he scrooged again and scrabbled and scratched and scraped, working busily with his little paws and muttering to himself, Â«Up we go! Up we go!Â» till at last, pop! his snout came out into the sunlight, and he found himself rolling in the warm grass of a great meadow.

Â«This is fine!Â» he said to himself. Â«This is better than whitewashing!Â» The sunshine struck hot on his fur, soft breezes caressed his heated brow, and after the seclusion of the cellarage he had lived in so long the carol of happy birds fell on his dulled hearing almost like a shout. Jumping off all his four legs at once, in the joy of living and the delight of spring without its cleaning, he pursued his way across the meadow till he reached the hedge on the further side.

Â«Hold up!Â» said an elderly rabbit at the gap. Â«SixpenceIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibited for the privilege of passing by the private road!Â» He was bowled over in an instant by the impatient and contemptuous Mole, who trotted along the side of the hedge chaffing the other rabbits as they peeped hurriedly from their holes to see what the row was about. Â«Onion-sauce! Onion-sauce!Â» he remarked jeeringly, and was gone before they could think of a thoroughly satisfactory reply. Then they all started grumbling at each other. Â«How STUPID you are! Why didn't you tell him..Â». Â«Well, why didn't YOU say..Â». Â«You might have reminded him..Â». and so on, in the usual way; but, of course, it was then much too late, as is always the case.

It all seemed too good to be true. Hither and thither through the meadows he rambled busily, along the hedgerows, across the copses, finding everywhere birds building, flowers budding, leaves thrusting â€“ everything happy, and progressive, and occupied. And instead of having an uneasy conscience pricking him and whispering Â«whitewash!Â» he somehow could only feel hIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedow jolly it was to be the only idle dog among all these busy citizens. After all, the best part of a holiday is perhaps not so much to be resting yourself, as to see all the other fellows busy working.

He thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen a river before â€“ this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again. All was a-shake and a-shiver â€“ glints and gleams and sparkles, rustle and swirl, chatter and bubble. The Mole was bewitched, entranced, fascinated. By the side of the river he trotted as one trots, when very small, by the side of a man who holds one spell-bound by exciting stories; and when tired at last, he sat on the bank, while the river still chattered on to him, a babbling procession of the best stories in the wIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedorld, sent from the heart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea.

As he sat on the grass and looked across the river, a dark hole in the bank opposite, just above the water's edge, caught his eye, and dreamily he fell to considering what a nice snug dwelling-place it would make for an animal with few wants and fond of a bijo riverside residence, above flood level and remote from noise and dust. As he gazed, something bright and small seemed to twinkle down in the heart of it, vanished, then twinkled once more like a tiny star. But it could hardly be a star in such an unlikely situation; and it was too glittering and small for a glow-worm. Then, as he looked, it winked at him, and so declared itself to be an eye; and a small face began gradually to grow up round it, like a frame round a picture.

A brown little face, with whiskers.

A grave round face, with the same twinkle in its eye that had first attracted his notice.

Small neat ears and thick silky hair.

It was the Water Rat!
Introductory fragment, copying is prohibited
Then the two animals stood and regarded each other cautiously.

Â«Hullo, Mole!Â» said the Water Rat.

Â«Hullo, Rat!Â» said the Mole.

Â«Would you like to come over?Â» enquired the Rat presently.

Â«Oh, its all very well to TALKÂ», said the Mole, rather pettishly, he being new to a river and riverside life and its ways.

The Rat said nothing, but stooped and unfastened a rope and hauled on it; then lightly stepped into a little boat which the Mole had not observed. It was painted blue outside and white within, and was just the size for two animals; and the Mole's whole heart went out to it at once, even though he did not yet fully understand its uses.

The Rat sculled smartly across and made fast. Then he held up his forepaw as the Mole stepped gingerly down. Â«Lean on that!Â» he said. Â«Now then, step lively!Â» and the Mole to his surprise and rapture found himself actually seated in the stern of a real boat.

Â«This has been a wonderful day!Â» said he, as the Rat shoved off and took to the scuIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedlls again. Â«Do you know, I've never been in a boat before in all my lifeÂ».

Â«What?Â» cried the Rat, open-mouthed: Â«Never been in a â€“ you never â€“ well I â€“ what have you been doing, then?Â»

Â«Is it so nice as all that?Â» asked the Mole shyly, though he was quite prepared to believe it as he leant back in his seat and surveyed the cushions, the oars, the rowlocks, and all the fascinating fittings, and felt the boat sway lightly under him.

Â«Nice? It's the ONLY thingÂ», said the Water Rat solemnly, as he leant forward for his stroke. Â«Believe me, my young friend, there is NOTHING â€“ absolute nothing â€“ half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats. Simply messingÂ», he went on dreamily: Â«messing â€“ about â€“ in â€“ boats; messing..Â».

Â«Look ahead, Rat!Â» cried the Mole suddenly.

It was too late. The boat struck the bank full tilt. The dreamer, the joyous oarsman, lay on his back at the bottom of the boat, his heels in the air.

Â«â€“Â about in boats â€“ or WITH boatsÂ»,Introductory fragment, copying is prohibited the Rat went on composedly, picking himself up with a pleasant laugh. Â«In or out of 'em, it doesn't matter. Nothing seems really to matter, that's the charm of it. Whether you get away, or whether you don't; whether you arrive at your destination or whether you reach somewhere else, or whether you never get anywhere at all, you're always busy, and you never do anything in particular; and when you've done it there's always something else to do, and you can do it if you like, but you'd much better not. Look here! If you've really nothing else on hand this morning, supposing we drop down the river together, and have a long day of it?Â»

The Mole waggled his toes from sheer happiness, spread his chest with a sigh of full contentment, and leaned back blissfully into the soft cushions. Â«WHAT a day I'm having!Â» he said. Â«Let us start at once!Â»

Â«Hold hard a minute, then!Â» said the Rat. He looped the painter through a ring in his landing-stage, climbed up into his hole above, and after a short interval reIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedappeared staggering under a fat, wicker luncheon-basket.

Â«Shove that under your feetÂ», he observed to the Mole, as he passed it down into the boat. Then he untied the painter and took the sculls again.

Â«What's inside it?Â» asked the Mole, wriggling with curiosity.

Â«There's cold chicken inside itÂ», replied the Rat briefly; Â«cold-tongue-cold-ham-cold-beef-pickled-gherkins-salad-french-rolls-cress-sandwiches-potted-meat-ginger-beer-lemonade-soda-water..Â».

Â«O stop, stopÂ», cried the Mole in ecstacies: Â«This is too much!Â»

Â«Do you really think so?Â» enquired the Rat seriously. Â«It's only what I always take on these little excursions; and the other animals are always telling me that I'm a mean beast and cut it VERY fine!Â»

The Mole never heard a word he was saying. Absorbed in the new life he was entering upon, intoxicated with the sparkle, the ripple, the scents and the sounds and the sunlight, he trailed a paw in the water and dreamed long waking dreams. The Water Rat, like the good lIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedittle fellow he was, sculled steadily on and forebore to disturb him.

Â«I like your clothes awfully, old chapÂ», he remarked after some half an hour or so had passed. Â«I'm going to get a black velvet smoking-suit myself some day, as soon as I can afford itÂ».

Â«I beg your pardonÂ», said the Mole, pulling himself together with an effort. Â«You must think me very rude; but all this is so new to me. So â€“ this â€“ is â€“ a â€“ River!Â»

Â«THE RiverÂ», corrected the Rat.

Â«And you really live by the river? What a jolly life!Â»

Â«By it and with it and on it and in itÂ», said the Rat. Â«It's brother and sister to me, and aunts, and company, and food and drink, and (naturally) washing. It's my world, and I don't want any other. What it hasn't got is not worth having, and what it doesn't know is not worth knowing. Lord! the times we've had together! Whether in winter or summer, spring or autumn, it's always got its fun and its excitements. When the floods are on in February, and my cellars and basemenIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedt are brimming with drink that's no good to me, and the brown water runs by my best bedroom window; or again when it all drops away and, shows patches of mud that smells like plum-cake, and the rushes and weed clog the channels, and I can potter about dry shod over most of the bed of it and find fresh food to eat, and things careless people have dropped out of boats!Â»

Â«But isn't it a bit dull at times?Â» the Mole ventured to ask. Â«Just you and the river, and no one else to pass a word with?Â»

Â«No one else to â€“ well, I mustn't be hard on youÂ», said the Rat with forbearance. Â«You're new to it, and of course you don't know. The bank is so crowded nowadays that many people are moving away altogether: O no, it isn't what it used to be, at all. Otters, kingfishers, dabchicks, moorhens, all of them about all day long and always wanting you to DO something â€“ as if a fellow had no business of his own to attend to!Â»

Â«What lies over THERE?Â» asked the Mole, waving a paw towards a background of woodlIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedand that darkly framed the water-meadows on one side of the river.

Â«That? O, that's just the Wild WoodÂ», said the Rat shortly. Â«We don't go there very much, we river-bankersÂ».

Â«Aren't they â€“ aren't they very NICE people in there?Â» said the Mole, a trifle nervously.

Â«W-e-llÂ», replied the Rat, Â«let me see. The squirrels are all right. AND the rabbits â€“ some of 'em, but rabbits are a mixed lot. And then there's Badger, of course. He lives right in the heart of it; wouldn't live anywhere else, either, if you paid him to do it. Dear old Badger! Nobody interferes with HIM. They'd better notÂ», he added significantly.

Â«Why, who SHOULD interfere with him?Â» asked the Mole.

Â«Well, of course â€“ there â€“ are othersÂ», explained the Rat in a hesitating sort of way.

Â«Weasels â€“ and stoats â€“ and foxes â€“ and so on. They're all right in a way â€“ I'm very good friends with them â€“ pass the time of day when we meet, and all that â€“ but they break out sometimes, there's no denying it,Introductory fragment, copying is prohibited and then â€“ well, you can't really trust them, and that's the factÂ».

The Mole knew well that it is quite against animal-etiquette to dwell on possible trouble ahead, or even to allude to it; so he dropped the subject.

Â«And beyond the Wild Wood again?Â» he asked: Â«Where it's all blue and dim, and one sees what may be hills or perhaps they mayn't, and something like the smoke of towns, or is it only cloud-drift?Â»

Â«Beyond the Wild Wood comes the Wide WorldÂ», said the Rat. Â«And that's something that doesn't matter, either to you or me. I've never been there, and I'm never going, nor you either, if you've got any sense at all. Don't ever refer to it again, please. Now then! Here's our backwater at last, where we're going to lunchÂ».

Leaving the main stream, they now passed into what seemed at first sight like a little land-locked lake. Green turf sloped down to either edge, brown snaky tree-roots gleamed below the surface of the quiet water, while ahead of them the silvery shoulder and foamy tIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedumble of a weir, arm-in-arm with a restless dripping mill-wheel, that held up in its turn a grey-gabled mill-house, filled the air with a soothing murmur of sound, dull and smothery, yet with little clear voices speaking up cheerfully out of it at intervals. It was so very beautiful that the Mole could only hold up both forepaws and gasp, Â«O my! O my! O my!Â»

The Rat brought the boat alongside the bank, made her fast, helped the still awkward Mole safely ashore, and swung out the luncheon-basket. The Mole begged as a favour to be allowed to unpack it all by himself; and the Rat was very pleased to indulge him, and to sprawl at full length on the grass and rest, while his excited friend shook out the table-cloth and spread it, took out all the mysterious packets one by one and arranged their contents in due order, still gasping, Â«O my! O my!Â» at each fresh revelation. When all was ready, the Rat said, Â«Now, pitch in, old fellow!Â» and the Mole was indeed very glad to obey, for he had started his spring-Introductory fragment, copying is prohibitedcleaning at a very early hour that morning, as people WILL do, and had not paused for bite or sup; and he had been through a very great deal since that distant time which now seemed so many days ago.

Â«What are you looking at?Â» said the Rat presently, when the edge of their hunger was somewhat dulled, and the Mole's eyes were able to wander off the table-cloth a little.

Â«I am lookingÂ», said the Mole, Â«at a streak of bubbles that I see travelling along the surface of the water. That is a thing that strikes me as funnyÂ».

Â«Bubbles? Oho!Â» said the Rat, and chirruped cheerily in an inviting sort of way.

A broad glistening muzzle showed itself above the edge of the bank, and the Otter hauled himself out and shook the water from his coat.

Â«Greedy beggars!Â» he observed, making for the provender. Â«Why didn't you invite me, Ratty?Â»

Â«This was an impromptu affairÂ», explained the Rat. Â«By the way â€“ my friend Mr. MoleÂ».

Â«Proud, I'm sureÂ», said the Otter, and the two animals were frieIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitednds forthwith.

Â«Such a rumpus everywhere!Â» continued the Otter. Â«All the world seems out on the river to-day. I came up this backwater to try and get a moment's peace, and then stumble upon you fellows!Â â€“ At least â€“ I beg pardon â€“ I don't exactly mean that, you knowÂ».

There was a rustle behind them, proceeding from a hedge wherein last year's leaves still clung thick, and a stripy head, with high shoulders behind it, peered forth on them.

Â«Come on, old Badger!Â» shouted the Rat.

The Badger trotted forward a pace or two; then grunted, Â«H'm! CompanyÂ», and turned his back and disappeared from view.

Â«That's JUST the sort of fellow he is!Â» observed the disappointed Rat. Â«Simply hates Society! Now we shan't see any more of him to-day. Well, tell us, WHO'S out on the river?Â»

Â«Toad's out, for oneÂ», replied the Otter. Â«In his brand-new wager-boat; new togs, new everything!Â»

The two animals looked at each other and laughed.

Â«Once, it was nothing but sailingÂ», said the RatIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibited, Â«Then he tired of that and took to punting. Nothing would please him but to punt all day and every day, and a nice mess he made of it. Last year it was house-boating, and we all had to go and stay with him in his house-boat, and pretend we liked it. He was going to spend the rest of his life in a house-boat. It's all the same, whatever he takes up; he gets tired of it, and starts on something freshÂ».

Â«Such a good fellow, tooÂ», remarked the Otter reflectively: Â«But no stability â€“ especially in a boat!Â»

From where they sat they could get a glimpse of the main stream across the island that separated them; and just then a wager-boat flashed into view, the rower â€“ a short, stout figure â€“ splashing badly and rolling a good deal, but working his hardest. The Rat stood up and hailed him, but Toad â€“ for it was he â€“ shook his head and settled sternly to his work.

Â«He'll be out of the boat in a minute if he rolls like thatÂ», said the Rat, sitting down again.

Â«Of course he willÂ», chuckleIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedd the Otter. Â«Did I ever tell you that good story about Toad and the lock-keeper? It happened this way. Toadâ€¦Â»

An errant May-fly swerved unsteadily athwart the current in the intoxicated fashion affected by young bloods of May-flies seeing life. A swirl of water and a Â«cloop!Â» and the May-fly was visible no more.

Neither was the Otter.

The Mole looked down. The voice was still in his ears, but the turf whereon he had sprawled was clearly vacant. Not an Otter to be seen, as far as the distant horizon.

But again there was a streak of bubbles on the surface of the river.

The Rat hummed a tune, and the Mole recollected that animal-etiquette forbade any sort of comment on the sudden disappearance of one's friends at any moment, for any reason or no reason whatever.

Â«Well, wellÂ», said the Rat, Â«I suppose we ought to be moving. I wonder which of us had better pack the luncheon-basket?Â» He did not speak as if he was frightfully eager for the treat.

Â«O, please let meÂ», said the Mole. SIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedo, of course, the Rat let him.

Packing the basket was not quite such pleasant work as unpacking the basket. It never is. But the Mole was bent on enjoying everything, and although just when he had got the basket packed and strapped up tightly he saw a plate staring up at him from the grass, and when the job had been done again the Rat pointed out a fork which anybody ought to have seen, and last of all, behold! the mustard pot, which he had been sitting on without knowing it â€“ still, somehow, the thing got finished at last, without much loss of temper.

The afternoon sun was getting low as the Rat sculled gently homewards in a dreamy mood, murmuring poetry-things over to himself, and not paying much attention to Mole. But the Mole was very full of lunch, and self-satisfaction, and pride, and already quite at home in a boat (so he thought) and was getting a bit restless besides: and presently he said, Â«Ratty! Please, I want to row, now!Â»

The Rat shook his head with a smile. Â«Not yet, my young frieIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedndÂ», he saidâ€” Â«wait till you've had a few lessons. It's not so easy as it looksÂ».

The Mole was quiet for a minute or two. But he began to feel more and more jealous of Rat, sculling so strongly and so easily along, and his pride began to whisper that he could do it every bit as well. He jumped up and seized the sculls, so suddenly, that the Rat, who was gazing out over the water and saying more poetry-things to himself, was taken by surprise and fell backwards off his seat with his legs in the air for the second time, while the triumphant Mole took his place and grabbed the sculls with entire confidence.

Â«Stop it, you SILLY ass!Â» cried the Rat, from the bottom of the boat. Â«You can't do it! You'll have us over!Â»

The Mole flung his sculls back with a flourish, and made a great dig at the water. He missed the surface altogether, his legs flew up above his head, and he found himself lying on the top of the prostrate Rat. Greatly alarmed, he made a grab at the side of the boat, and the next momeIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitednt â€“ Sploosh!

Over went the boat, and he found himself struggling in the river.

O my, how cold the water was, and O, how VERY wet it felt. How it sang in his ears as he went down, down, down! How bright and welcome the sun looked as he rose to the surface coughing and spluttering! How black was his despair when he felt himself sinking again! Then a firm paw gripped him by the back of his neck. It was the Rat, and he was evidently laughing â€“ the Mole could FEEL him laughing, right down his arm and through his paw, and so into his â€“ the Mole's â€“ neck.

The Rat got hold of a scull and shoved it under the Mole's arm; then he did the same by the other side of him and, swimming behind, propelled the helpless animal to shore, hauled him out, and set him down on the bank, a squashy, pulpy lump of misery.

When the Rat had rubbed him down a bit, and wrung some of the wet out of him, he said, Â«Now, then, old fellow! Trot up and down the towing-path as hard as you can, till you're warm and dry again, Introductory fragment, copying is prohibitedwhile I dive for the luncheon-basketÂ».

So the dismal Mole, wet without and ashamed within, trotted about till he was fairly dry, while the Rat plunged into the water again, recovered the boat, righted her and made her fast, fetched his floating property to shore by degrees, and finally dived successfully for the luncheon-basket and struggled to land with it.

When all was ready for a start once more, the Mole, limp and dejected, took his seat in the stern of the boat; and as they set off, he said in a low voice, broken with emotion, Â«Ratty, my generous friend! I am very sorry indeed for my foolish and ungrateful conduct. My heart quite fails me when I think how I might have lost that beautiful luncheon-basket. Indeed, I have been a complete ass, and I know it. Will you overlook it this once and forgive me, and let things go on as before?Â»

Â«That's all right, bless you!Â» responded the Rat cheerily. Â«What's a little wet to a Water Rat? I'm more in the water than out of it most days. Don't you thinkIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibited any more about it; and, look here! I really think you had better come and stop with me for a little time. It's very plain and rough, you know â€“ not like Toad's house at all â€“ but you haven't seen that yet; still, I can make you comfortable. And I'll teach you to row, and to swim, and you'll soon be as handy on the water as any of usÂ».

The Mole was so touched by his kind manner of speaking that he could find no voice to answer him; and he had to brush away a tear or two with the back of his paw. But the Rat kindly looked in another direction, and presently the Mole's spirits revived again, and he was even able to give some straight back-talk to a couple of moorhens who were sniggering to each other about his bedraggled appearance.

When they got home, the Rat made a bright fire in the parlour, and planted the Mole in an arm-chair in front of it, having fetched down a dressing-gown and slippers for him, and told him river stories till supper-time. Very thrilling stories they were, too, to an earth-dwIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedelling animal like Mole. Stories about weirs, and sudden floods, and leaping pikes, and steamers that flung hard bottles â€“ at least bottles were certainly flung, and FROM steamers, so presumably BY them[2 - and steamers that flung hard bottles â€“ at least bottles were certainly flung, and FROM steamers, so presumably BY them â€” Ğ¸ Ğ¿Ñ€Ğ¾ Ğ¿Ğ°Ñ€Ğ¾Ñ…Ğ¾Ğ´Ñ‹, ĞºĞ¾Ñ‚Ğ¾Ñ€Ñ‹Ğµ Ñ€Ğ°Ğ·Ğ±Ñ€Ğ°ÑÑ‹Ğ²Ğ°ÑÑ‚ Ğ±ÑƒÑ‚Ñ‹Ğ»ĞºĞ¸, Ğ¿Ğ¾ ĞºÑ€Ğ°Ğ¹Ğ½ĞµĞ¹ Ğ¼ĞµÑ€Ğµ, Ğ±ÑƒÑ‚Ñ‹Ğ»ĞºĞ¸ Ğ»ĞµÑ‚ÑÑ‚ Ğ¸Ğ¼ĞµĞ½Ğ½Ğ¾ Ñ Ğ¿Ğ°Ñ€Ğ¾Ñ…Ğ¾Ğ´Ğ¾Ğ², Ñ‚.Â Ğµ.

Supper was a most cheerful meal; but very shortly afterwards a terribly sleepy Mole had to be escorted upstairs by his considerate host, to the best bedroom, where he soon laid his head on his pillow in great peace and contentment, knowing that his new-foundIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibited friend the River was lapping the sill of his window.

This day was only the first of many similar ones for the emancipated Mole, each of them longer and full of interest as the ripening summer moved onward. He learnt to swim and to row, and entered into the joy of running water; and with his ear to the reed-stems he caught, at intervals, something of what the wind went whispering so constantly among them.




II.Â The open road


Â«RattyÂ», said the Mole suddenly, one bright summer morning, Â«if you please, I want to ask you a favourÂ».

The Rat was sitting on the river bank, singing a little song. He had just composed it himself, so he was very taken up with it, and would not pay proper attention to Mole or anything else. Since early morning he had been swimming in the river, in company with his friends the ducks. And when the ducks stood on their heads suddenly, as ducks will, he would dive down and tickle their necks, just under where their chins would be if ducks had chins, till they were forIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedced to come to the surface again in a hurry, spluttering and angry and shaking their feathers at him, for it is impossible to say quite ALL you feel when your head is under water. At last they implored him to go away and attend to his own affairs and leave them to mind theirs. So the Rat went away, and sat on the river bank in the sun, and made up a song about them, which he called


Â«Ducks' DittyÂ»

		All along the backwater,
		Through the rushes tall,
		Ducks are a-dabbling,
		Up tails all!
		Ducks' tails, drakes' tails,
		Yellow feet a-quiver,
		Yellow bills all out of sight
		Busy in the river!
		Slushy green undergrowth
		Where the roach swimâ€”
		Here we keep our larder,
		Cool and full and dim.
		Everyone for what he likes!
		WE like to be
		Heads down, tails up,
		Dabbling free!
		High in the blue above
		Swifts whirl and callâ€”
		WE are down a-dabbling
		Up tails all!

Â«I don't know that I think so VERY much of that little song, RatÂ», observed the Mole cautiously. He wasIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibited no poet himself and didn't care who knew it; and he had a candid nature.

Â«Nor don't the ducks neitherÂ», replied the Rat cheerfully. Â«They say, â€˜WHY can't fellows be allowed to do what they like WHEN they like and AS they like, instead of other fellows sitting on banks and watching them all the time and making remarks and poetry and things about them? What NONSENSE it all is!' That's what the ducks sayÂ».

Â«So it is, so it isÂ», said the Mole, with great heartiness.

Â«No, it isn't!Â» cried the Rat indignantly.

Â«Well then, it isn't, it isn'tÂ», replied the Mole soothingly. Â«But what I wanted to ask you was, won't you take me to call on Mr. Toad? I've heard so much about him, and I do so want to make his acquaintanceÂ».

Â«Why, certainlyÂ», said the good-natured Rat, jumping to his feet and dismissing poetry from his mind for the day. Â«Get the boat out, and we'll paddle up there at once. It's never the wrong time to call on Toad. Early or late he's always the same fellow. Always good-tempeIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedred, always glad to see you, always sorry when you go!Â»

Â«He must be a very nice animalÂ», observed the Mole, as he got into the boat and took the sculls, while the Rat settled himself comfortably in the stern.

Â«He is indeed the best of animalsÂ», replied Rat. Â«So simple, so good-natured, and so affectionate. Perhaps he's not very clever â€“ we can't all be geniuses; and it may be that he is both boastful and conceited. But he has got some great qualities, has ToadyÂ».

Rounding a bend in the river, they came in sight of a handsome, dignified old house of mellowed red brick, with well-kept lawns reaching down to the water's edge.

Â«There's Toad HallÂ», said the Rat; Â«and that creek on the left, where the notice-board says, â€˜Private. No landing allowed,' leads to his boat-house, where we'll leave the boat. The stables are over there to the right. That's the banqueting-hall you're looking at now â€“ very old, that is. Toad is rather rich, you know, and this is really one of the nicest houses inIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibited these parts, though we never admit as much to ToadÂ».

They glided up the creek, and the Mole slipped his sculls as they passed into the shadow of a large boat-house. Here they saw many handsome boats, slung from the cross beams or hauled up on a slip, but none in the water; and the place had an unused and a deserted air.

The Rat looked around him. Â«I understandÂ», said he. Â«Boating is played out. He's tired of it, and done with it. I wonder what new fad he has taken up now? Come along and let's look him up. We shall hear all about it quite soon enoughÂ».

They disembarked, and strolled across the gay flower-decked lawns in search of Toad, whom they presently happened upon resting in a wicker garden-chair[3 - in a wicker garden-chair â€” Ğ½Ğ° Ğ¿Ğ»ĞµÑ‚ĞµĞ½Ğ¾Ğ¼ ÑĞ°Ğ´Ğ¾Ğ²Ğ¾Ğ¼ ÑÑ‚ÑƒĞ»Ğµ], with a pre-occupied expression of face, and a large map spread out on his knees.

Â«Hooray!Â» he cried, jumping up on seeing them, Â«this is splendid!Â» He shook the paws of both of them warmly, never waiting for aIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedn introduction to the Mole. Â«How KIND of you!Â» he went on, dancing round them. Â«I was just going to send a boat down the river for you, Ratty, with strict orders that you were to be fetched up here at once, whatever you were doing. I want you badly â€“ both of you. Now what will you take? Come inside and have something! You don't know how lucky it is, your turning up just now!Â»

Â«Let's sit quiet a bit, Toady!Â» said the Rat, throwing himself into an easy chair, while the Mole took another by the side of him and made some civil remark about Toad's Â«delightful residenceÂ».

Â«Finest house on the whole riverÂ», cried Toad boisterously. Â«Or anywhere else, for that matterÂ», he could not help adding.

Here the Rat nudged the Mole. Unfortunately the Toad saw him do it, and turned very red. There was a moment's painful silence. Then Toad burst out laughing. Â«All right, RattyÂ», he said. Â«It's only my way, you know. And it's not such a very bad house, is it? You know you rather like it yourself. Now, lIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedook here. Let's be sensible. You are the very animals I wanted. You've got to help me. It's most important!Â»

Â«It's about your rowing, I supposeÂ», said the Rat, with an innocent air. Â«You're getting on fairly well, though you splash a good bit still. With a great deal of patience, and any quantity of coaching, you may..Â».

Â«O, pooh! boating!Â» interrupted the Toad, in great disgust. Â«Silly boyish amusement. I've given that up LONG ago. Sheer waste of time, that's what it is. It makes me downright sorry to see you fellows, who ought to know better, spending all your energies in that aimless manner. No, I've discovered the real thing, the only genuine occupation for a life time. I propose to devote the remainder of mine to it, and can only regret the wasted years that lie behind me, squandered in trivialities. Come with me, dear Ratty, and your amiable friend also, if he will be so very good, just as far as the stable-yard, and you shall see what you shall see!Â»

He led the way to the stable-yard Introductory fragment, copying is prohibitedaccordingly, the Rat following with a most mistrustful expression; and there, drawn out of the coach house into the open, they saw a gipsy caravan, shining with newness, painted a canary-yellow picked out with green, and red wheels.

Â«There you are!Â» cried the Toad, straddling and expanding himself. Â«There's real life for you, embodied in that little cart. The open road, the dusty highway, the heath, the common, the hedgerows, the rolling downs! Camps, villages, towns, cities! Here to-day, up and off to somewhere else to-morrow! Travel, change, interest, excitement! The whole world before you, and a horizon that's always changing! And mind! this is the very finest cart of its sort that was ever built, without any exception. Come inside and look at the arrangements. Planned 'em all myself, I did!Â»

The Mole was tremendously interested and excited, and followed him eagerly up the steps and into the interior of the caravan. The Rat only snorted and thrust his hands deep into his pockets, remaining where Introductory fragment, copying is prohibitedhe was.

It was indeed very compact and comfortable. Little sleeping bunks â€“ a little table that folded up against the wall â€“ a cooking-stove, lockers, bookshelves, a bird-cage with a bird in it; and pots, pans, jugs and kettles of every size and variety.

Â«All complete!Â» said the Toad triumphantly, pulling open a locker. Â«You see â€“ biscuits, potted lobster, sardines â€“ everything you can possibly want. Soda-water here â€“ baccy there â€“ letter-paper, bacon, jam, cards and dominoes â€“ you'll findÂ», he continued, as they descended the steps again, Â«you'll find that nothing what ever has been forgotten, when we make our start this afternoonÂ».

Â«I beg your pardonÂ», said the Rat slowly, as he chewed a straw, Â«but did I overhear you say something about â€˜WE,' and â€˜START,' and â€˜THIS AFTERNOON?Â»

Â«Now, you dear good old RattyÂ», said Toad, imploringly, Â«don't begin talking in that stiff and sniffy sort of way, because you know you've GOT to come. I can't possibly manage without you,Introductory fragment, copying is prohibited so please consider it settled, and don't argue â€“ it's the one thing I can't stand. You surely don't mean to stick to your dull fusty old river all your life, and just live in a hole in a bank, and BOAT? I want to show you the world! I'm going to make an ANIMAL of you, my boy!Â»

Â«I don't careÂ», said the Rat, doggedly. Â«I'm not coming, and that's flat. And I AM going to stick to my old river, AND live in a hole, AND boat, as I've always done. And what's more, Mole's going to stick me and do as I do, aren't you, Mole?Â»

Â«Of course I amÂ», said the Mole, loyally. Â«I'll always stick to you, Rat, and what you say is to be â€“ has got to be. All the same, it sounds as if it might have been â€“ well, rather fun, you know!Â» he added, wistfully. Poor Mole! The Life Adventurous was so new a thing to him, and so thrilling; and this fresh aspect of it was so tempting; and he had fallen in love at first sight with the canary-coloured cart and all its little fitments.

The Rat saw what was passing in his miIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitednd, and wavered. He hated disappointing people, and he was fond of the Mole, and would do almost anything to oblige him. Toad was watching both of them closely.

Â«Come along in, and have some lunchÂ», he said, diplomatically, Â«and we'll talk it over. We needn't decide anything in a hurry. Of course, I don't really care. I only want to give pleasure to you fellows. â€˜Live for others!' That's my motto in lifeÂ».

During luncheon â€“ which was excellent, of course, as everything at Toad Hall always was â€“ the Toad simply let himself go. Disregarding the Rat, he proceeded to play upon the inexperienced Mole as on a harp. Naturally a voluble animal, and always mastered by his imagination, he painted the prospects of the trip and the joys of the open life and the roadside in such glowing colours that the Mole could hardly sit in his chair for excitement. Somehow, it soon seemed taken for granted by all three of them that the trip was a settled thing; and the Rat, though still unconvinced in his mind, alloweIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedd his good-nature to over-ride his personal objections. He could not bear to disappoint his two friends, who were already deep in schemes and anticipations, planning out each day's separate occupation for several weeks ahead.

When they were quite ready, the now triumphant Toad led his companions to the paddock and set them to capture the old grey horse, who, without having been consulted, and to his own extreme annoyance, had been told off by Toad for the dustiest job in this dusty expedition. He frankly preferred the paddock, and took a deal of catching. Meantime Toad packed the lockers still tighter with necessaries, and hung nosebags, nets of onions, bundles of hay, and baskets from the bottom of the cart. At last the horse was caught and harnessed, and they set off, all talking at once, each animal either trudging by the side of the cart or sitting on the shaft, as the humour took him. It was a golden afternoon. The smell of the dust they kicked up was rich and satisfying; out of thick orchards on eithIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibiteder side of the road, birds called and whistled to them cheerily; good-natured wayfarers, passing them, gave them Â«Good-dayÂ», or stopped to say nice things about their beautiful cart; and rabbits, sitting at their front doors in the hedgerows, held up their fore-paws, and said, Â«O my! O my! O my!Â»

Late in the evening, tired and happy and miles from home, they drew up on a remote common far from habitations, turned the horse loose to graze, and ate their simple supper sitting on the grass by the side of the cart. Toad talked big about all he was going to do in the days to come, while stars grew fuller and larger all around them, and a yellow moon, appearing suddenly and silently from nowhere in particular, came to keep them company and listen to their talk. At last they turned in to their little bunks in the cart; and Toad, kicking out his legs, sleepily said, Â«Well, good night, you fellows! This is the real life for a gentleman! Talk about your old river!Â»

Â«I DON'T talk about my riverÂ», replied tIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedhe patient Rat. Â«You KNOW I don't, Toad. But I THINK about itÂ», he added pathetically, in a lower tone: Â«I think about it â€“ all the time!Â»

The Mole reached out from under his blanket, felt for the Rat's paw in the darkness, and gave it a squeeze. Â«I'll do whatever you like, RattyÂ», he whispered. Â«Shall we run away to-morrow morning, quite early â€“ VERY early â€“ and go back to our dear old hole on the river?Â»

Â«No, no, we'll see it outÂ», whispered back the Rat. Â«Thanks awfully, but I ought to stick by Toad till this trip is ended. It wouldn't be safe for him to be left to himself. It won't take very long. His fads never do. Good night!Â»

The end was indeed nearer than even the Rat suspected.

After so much open air and excitement the Toad slept very soundly, and no amount of shaking could rouse him out of bed next morning. So the Mole and Rat turned to, quietly and manfully, and while the Rat saw to the horse, and lit a fire, and cleaned last night's cups and platters, and got things rIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedeady for breakfast, the Mole trudged off to the nearest village, a long way off, for milk and eggs and various necessaries the Toad had, of course, forgotten to provide. The hard work had all been done, and the two animals were resting, thoroughly exhausted, by the time Toad appeared on the scene, fresh and gay, remarking what a pleasant easy life it was they were all leading now, after the cares and worries and fatigues of housekeeping at home.

They had a pleasant ramble that day over grassy downs and along narrow by-lanes, and camped as before, on a common, only this time the two guests took care that Toad should do his fair share of work. In consequence, when the time came for starting next morning, Toad was by no means so rapturous about the simplicity of the primitive life, and indeed attempted to resume his place in his bunk, whence he was hauled by force. Their way lay, as before, across country by narrow lanes, and it was not till the afternoon that they came out on the high-road, their first high-Introductory fragment, copying is prohibitedroad; and there disaster, fleet and unforeseen, sprang out on them â€“ disaster momentous indeed to their expedition, but simply overwhelming in its effect on the after-career of Toad.

They were strolling along the high-road easily, the Mole by the horse's head, talking to him, since the horse had complained that he was being frightfully left out of it, and nobody considered him in the least; the Toad and the Water Rat walking behind the cart talking together â€“ at least Toad was talking, and Rat was saying at intervals, Â«Yes, precisely; and what did YOU say to HIM?Â» â€“ and thinking all the time of something very different, when far behind them they heard a faint warning hum; like the drone of a distant bee. Glancing back, they saw a small cloud of dust, with a dark centre of energy, advancing on them at incredible speed, while from out the dust a faint Â«Poop-poop!Â» wailed like an uneasy animal in pain. Hardly regarding it, they turned to resume their conversation, when in an instant (as it seemed) tIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedhe peaceful scene was changed, and with a blast of wind and a whirl of sound that made them jump for the nearest ditch, it was on them! The Â«Poop-poopÂ» rang with a brazen shout in their ears, they had a moment's glimpse of an interior of glittering plate-glass and rich morocco, and the magnificent motor-car, immense, breath-snatching, passionate, with its pilot tense and hugging his wheel, possessed all earth and air for the fraction of a second, flung an enveloping cloud of dust that blinded and enwrapped them utterly, and then dwindled to a speck in the far distance, changed back into a droning bee once more.

The old grey horse, dreaming, as he plodded along, of his quiet paddock, in a new raw situation such as this simply abandoned himself to his natural emotions. Rearing, plunging, backing steadily, in spite of all the Mole's efforts at his head, and all the Mole's lively language directed at his better feelings, he drove the cart backwards towards the deep ditch at the side of the road. It wavered aIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedn instant â€“ then there was a heartrending crash â€“ and the canary-coloured cart, their pride and their joy, lay on its side in the ditch, an irredeemable wreck.

The Rat danced up and down in the road, simply transported with passion. Â«You villains!Â» he shouted, shaking both fists, Â«You scoundrels, you highwaymen, you â€“ you â€“ roadhogs!Â â€“ I'll have the law of you! I'll report you! I'll take you through all the Courts!Â» His home-sickness had quite slipped away from him, and for the moment he was the skipper of the canary-coloured vessel driven on a shoal by the reckless jockeying of rival mariners, and he was trying to recollect all the fine and biting things he used to say to masters of steam-launches when their wash, as they drove too near the bank, used to flood his parlour-carpet at home.

Toad sat straight down in the middle of the dusty road, his legs stretched out before him, and stared fixedly in the direction of the disappearing motor-car. He breathed short, his face wore a placid satIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedisfied expression, and at intervals he faintly murmured Â«Poop-poop!Â»

The Mole was busy trying to quiet the horse, which he succeeded in doing after a time. Then he went to look at the cart, on its side in the ditch. It was indeed a sorry sight. Panels and windows smashed, axles hopelessly bent, one wheel off, sardine-tins scattered over the wide world, and the bird in the bird-cage sobbing pitifully and calling to be let out.

The Rat came to help him, but their united efforts were not sufficient to right the cart. Â«Hi! Toad!Â» they cried. Â«Come and bear a hand, can't you![4 - Come and bear a hand, can't you!Â â€“ ĞÑƒ Ğ¶Ğµ, Ğ¸Ğ´Ğ¸ Ğ¸ Ğ¿Ğ¾Ğ¼Ğ¾Ğ³Ğ¸ Ğ½Ğ°Ğ¼!]Â»

The Toad never answered a word, or budged from his seat in the road; so they went to see what was the matter with him. They found him in a sort of a trance, a happy smile on his face, his eyes still fixed on the dusty wake of their destroyer. At intervals he was still heard to murmur Â«Poop-poop!Â»

The Rat shook him by the shoulder. Â«Are yIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedou coming to help us, Toad?Â» he demanded sternly.

Â«Glorious, stirring sight!Â» murmured Toad, never offering to move. Â«The poetry of motion! The REAL way to travel! The ONLY way to travel! Here to-day â€“ in next week to-morrow! Villages skipped, towns and cities jumped â€“ always somebody else's horizon! O bliss! O poop-poop! O my! O my!Â»

Â«O STOP being an ass, Toad!Â» cried the Mole despairingly.

Â«And to think I never KNEW!Â» went on the Toad in a dreamy monotone. Â«All those wasted years that lie behind me, I never knew, never even DREAMT! But NOW â€“ but now that I know, now that I fully realise! O what a flowery track lies spread before me, henceforth! What dust-clouds shall spring up behind me as I speed on my reckless way! What carts I shall fling carelessly into the ditch in the wake of my magnificent onset! Horrid little carts â€“ common carts â€“ canary-coloured carts!Â»

Â«What are we to do with him?Â» asked the Mole of the Water Rat.

Â«Nothing at allÂ», replied the Rat firmly. ÂIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibited«Because there is really nothing to be done. You see, I know him from of old. He is now possessed. He has got a new craze, and it always takes him that way, in its first stage. He'll continue like that for days now, like an animal walking in a happy dream, quite useless for all practical purposes. Never mind him. Let's go and see what there is to be done about the cartÂ».

A careful inspection showed them that, even if they succeeded in righting it by themselves, the cart would travel no longer. The axles were in a hopeless state, and the missing wheel was shattered into pieces.

The Rat knotted the horse's reins over his back and took him by the head, carrying the bird cage and its hysterical occupant in the other hand. Â«Come on!Â» he said grimly to the Mole. Â«It's five or six miles to the nearest town, and we shall just have to walk it. The sooner we make a start the betterÂ».

Â«But what about Toad?Â» asked the Mole anxiously, as they set off together. Â«We can't leave him here, sitting in the middIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedle of the road by himself, in the distracted state he's in! It's not safe. Supposing another Thing were to come along?Â»

Â«O, BOTHER ToadÂ», said the Rat savagely; Â«I've done with him!Â»

They had not proceeded very far on their way, however, when there was a pattering of feet behind them, and Toad caught them up and thrust a paw inside the elbow of each of them; still breathing short and staring into vacancy.

Â«Now, look here, Toad!Â» said the Rat sharply: Â«as soon as we get to the town, you'll have to go straight to the police-station, and see if they know anything about that motor-car and who it belongs to, and lodge a complaint against it. And then you'll have to go to a blacksmith's or a wheelwright's and arrange for the cart to be fetched and mended and put to rights. It'll take time, but it's not quite a hopeless smash. Meanwhile, the Mole and I will go to an inn and find comfortable rooms where we can stay till the cart's ready, and till your nerves have recovered their shockÂ».

Â«Police-Introductory fragment, copying is prohibitedstation! Complaint!Â» murmured Toad dreamily. Â«Me COMPLAIN of that beautiful, that heavenly vision that has been vouchsafed me! MEND THE CART! I've done with carts for ever. I never want to see the cart, or to hear of it, again. O, Ratty! You can't think how obliged I am to you for consenting to come on this trip! I wouldn't have gone without you, and then I might never have seen that â€“ that swan, that sunbeam, that thunderbolt! I might never have heard that entrancing sound, or smelt that bewitching smell! I owe it all to you, my best of friends!Â»

The Rat turned from him in despair. Â«You see what it is?Â» he said to the Mole, addressing him across Toad's head: Â«He's quite hopeless. I give it up â€“ when we get to the town we'll go to the railway station, and with luck we may pick up a train there that'll get us back to riverbank to-night. And if ever you catch me going a-pleasuring with this provoking animal again!Â»

He snorted, and during the rest of that weary trudge addressed his remarks excluIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedsively to Mole.

On reaching the town they went straight to the station and deposited Toad in the second-class waiting-room, giving a porter twopence to keep a strict eye on him. They then left the horse at an inn stable, and gave what directions they could about the cart and its contents. Eventually, a slow train having landed them at a station not very far from Toad Hall, they escorted the spell-bound, sleep-walking Toad to his door, put him inside it, and instructed his housekeeper to feed him, undress him, and put him to bed. Then they got out their boat from the boat-house, sculled down the river home, and at a very late hour sat down to supper in their own cosy riverside parlour, to the Rat's great joy and contentment.

The following evening the Mole, who had risen late and taken things very easy all day, was sitting on the bank fishing, when the Rat, who had been looking up his friends and gossiping, came strolling along to find him. Â«Heard the news?Â» he said. Â«There's nothing else being talked Introductory fragment, copying is prohibitedabout, all along the river bank. Toad went up to Town by an early train this morning. And he has ordered a large and very expensive motor-carÂ».




III.Â The wild wood


The Mole had long wanted to make the acquaintance of the Badger. He seemed, by all accounts, to be such an important personage and, though rarely visible, to make his unseen influence felt by everybody about the place. But whenever the Mole mentioned his wish to the Water Rat he always found himself put off. Â«It's all rightÂ», the Rat would say. Â«Badger'll turn up some day or other â€“ he's always turning up â€“ and then I'll introduce you. The best of fellows! But you must not only take him AS you find him, but WHEN you find himÂ».

Â«Couldn't you ask him here dinner or something?Â» said the Mole.

Â«He wouldn't comeÂ», replied the Rat simply. Â«Badger hates Society, and invitations, and dinner, and all that sort of thingÂ».

Â«Well, then, supposing we go and call on HIM?Â» suggested the Mole.

Â«O, I'm sure he wouldn't liIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedke that at ALLÂ», said the Rat, quite alarmed. Â«He's so very shy, he'd be sure to be offended. I've never even ventured to call on him at his own home myself, though I know him so well. Besides, we can't. It's quite out of the question, because he lives in the very middle of the Wild WoodÂ».

Â«Well, supposing he doesÂ», said the Mole. Â«You told me the Wild Wood was all right, you knowÂ».

Â«O, I know, I know, so it isÂ», replied the Rat evasively. Â«But I think we won't go there just now. Not JUST yet. It's a long way, and he wouldn't be at home at this time of year anyhow, and he'll be coming along some day, if you'll wait quietlyÂ».

The Mole had to be content with this. But the Badger never came along, and every day brought its amusements, and it was not till summer was long over, and cold and frost and miry ways kept them much indoors, and the swollen river raced past outside their windows with a speed that mocked at boating of any sort or kind, that he found his thoughts dwelling again with muchIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibited persistence on the solitary grey Badger, who lived his own life by himself, in his hole in the middle of the Wild Wood.

In the winter time the Rat slept a great deal, retiring early and rising late. During his short day he sometimes scribbled poetry or did other small domestic jobs about the house; and, of course, there were always animals dropping in for a chat, and consequently there was a good deal of story-telling and comparing notes on the past summer and all its doings.

Such a rich chapter it had been, when one came to look back on it all! With illustrations so numerous and so very highly coloured! The pageant of the river bank had marched steadily along, unfolding itself in scene-pictures that succeeded each other in stately procession. Purple loosestrife arrived early, shaking luxuriant tangled locks along the edge of the mirror whence its own face laughed back at it. Willow-herb, tender and wistful, like a pink sunset cloud, was not slow to follow. Comfrey, the purple hand-in-hand with the whiIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedte, crept forth to take its place in the line; and at last one morning the diffident and delaying dog-rose stepped delicately on the stage, and one knew, as if string-music had announced it in stately chords that strayed into a gavotte, that June at last was here. One member of the company was still awaited; the shepherd-boy for the nymphs to woo, the knight for whom the ladies waited at the window, the prince that was to kiss the sleeping summer back to life and love. But when meadow-sweet, debonair and odorous in amber jerkin, moved graciously to his place in the group, then the play was ready to begin.

And what a play it had been! Drowsy animals, snug in their holes while wind and rain were battering at their doors, recalled still keen mornings, an hour before sunrise, when the white mist, as yet undispersed, clung closely along the surface of the water; then the shock of the early plunge, the scamper along the bank, and the radiant transformation of earth, air, and water, when suddenly the sun was withIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibited them again, and grey was gold and colour was born and sprang out of the earth once more. They recalled the languorous siesta of hot mid-day, deep in green undergrowth, the sun striking through in tiny golden shafts and spots; the boating and bathing of the afternoon, the rambles along dusty lanes and through yellow cornfields; and the long, cool evening at last, when so many threads were gathered up, so many friendships rounded, and so many adventures planned for the morrow. There was plenty to talk about on those short winter days when the animals found themselves round the fire; still, the Mole had a good deal of spare time on his hands, and so one afternoon, when the Rat in his arm-chair before the blaze was alternately dozing and trying over rhymes that wouldn't fit, he formed the resolution to go out by himself and explore the Wild Wood, and perhaps strike up an acquaintance with Mr. Badger.

It was a cold still afternoon with a hard steely sky overhead, when he slipped out of the warm parlour into thIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitede open air. The country lay bare and entirely leafless around him, and he thought that he had never seen so far and so intimately into the insides of things as on that winter day when Nature was deep in her annual slumber and seemed to have kicked the clothes off. Copses, dells, quarries and all hidden places, which had been mysterious mines for exploration in leafy summer, now exposed themselves and their secrets pathetically, and seemed to ask him to overlook their shabby poverty for a while, till they could riot in rich masquerade as before, and trick and entice him with the old deceptions. It was pitiful in a way, and yet cheering â€“ even exhilarating. He was glad that he liked the country undecorated, hard, and stripped of its finery. He had got down to the bare bones of it, and they were fine and strong and simple. He did not want the warm clover and the play of seeding grasses; the screens of quickset, the billowy drapery of beech and elm seemed best away; and with great cheerfulness of spirit he pushIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibiteded on towards the Wild Wood, which lay before him low and threatening, like a black reef in some still southern sea.

There was nothing to alarm him at first entry. Twigs crackled under his feet, logs tripped him, funguses on stumps resembled caricatures, and startled him for the moment by their likeness to something familiar and far away; but that was all fun, and exciting. It led him on, and he penetrated to where the light was less, and trees crouched nearer and nearer, and holes made ugly mouths at him on either side.

Everything was very still now. The dusk advanced on him steadily, rapidly, gathering in behind and before; and the light seemed to be draining away like flood-water.

Then the faces began.

It was over his shoulder, and indistinctly, that he first thought he saw a face; a little evil wedge-shaped face, looking out at him from a hole. When he turned and confronted it, the thing had vanished.

He quickened his pace, telling himself cheerfully not to begin imagining things, or there Introductory fragment, copying is prohibitedwould be simply no end to it. He passed another hole, and another, and another; and then â€“ yes!Â â€“ no!Â â€“ yes! certainly a little narrow face, with hard eyes, had flashed up for an instant from a hole, and was gone. He hesitated â€“ braced himself up for an effort and strode on. Then suddenly, and as if it had been so all the time, every hole, far and near, and there were hundreds of them, seemed to possess its face, coming and going rapidly, all fixing on him glances of malice and hatred: all hard-eyed and evil and sharp.

If he could only get away from the holes in the banks, he thought, there would be no more faces. He swung off the path and plunged into the untrodden places of the wood.

Then the whistling began.

Very faint and shrill it was, and far behind him, when first he heard it; but somehow it made him hurry forward. Then, still very faint and shrill, it sounded far ahead of him, and made him hesitate and want to go back. As he halted in indecision it broke out on either side, and seemIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibiteded to be caught up and passed on throughout the whole length of the wood to its farthest limit. They were up and alert and ready, evidently, whoever they were! And he â€“ he was alone, and unarmed, and far from any help; and the night was closing in.

Then the pattering began.

He thought it was only falling leaves at first, so slight and delicate was the sound of it. Then as it grew it took a regular rhythm, and he knew it for nothing else but the pat-pat-pat of little feet still a very long way off. Was it in front or behind? It seemed to be first one, and then the other, then both. It grew and it multiplied, till from every quarter as he listened anxiously, leaning this way and that, it seemed to be closing in on him. As he stood still to hearken, a rabbit came running hard towards him through the trees. He waited, expecting it to slacken pace, or to swerve from him into a different course. Instead, the animal almost brushed him as it dashed past, his face set and hard, his eyes staring. Â«Get out of tIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedhis, you fool, get out!Â» the Mole heard him mutter as he swung round a stump and disappeared down a friendly burrow.

The pattering increased till it sounded like sudden hail on the dry leaf-carpet spread around him. The whole wood seemed running now, running hard, hunting, chasing, closing in round something or â€“ somebody? In panic, he began to run too, aimlessly, he knew not whither. He ran up against things, he fell over things and into things, he darted under things and dodged round things. At last he took refuge in the deep dark hollow of an old beech tree, which offered shelter, concealment â€“ perhaps even safety, but who could tell? Anyhow, he was too tired to run any further, and could only snuggle down into the dry leaves which had drifted into the hollow and hope he was safe for a time. And as he lay there panting and trembling, and listened to the whistlings and the patterings outside, he knew it at last, in all its fullness, that dread thing which other little dwellers in field and hedgerow Introductory fragment, copying is prohibitedhad encountered here, and known as their darkest moment â€“ that thing which the Rat had vainly tried to shield him from â€“ the Terror of the Wild Wood!

Meantime the Rat, warm and comfortable, dozed by his fireside. His paper of half-finished verses slipped from his knee, his head fell back, his mouth opened, and he wandered by the verdant banks of dream-rivers. Then a coal slipped, the fire crackled and sent up a spurt of flame, and he woke with a start. Remembering what he had been engaged upon, he reached down to the floor for his verses, pored over them for a minute, and then looked round for the Mole to ask him if he knew a good rhyme for something or other.

But the Mole was not there.

He listened for a time. The house seemed very quiet.

Then he called Â«Moly!Â» several times, and, receiving no answer, got up and went out into the hall.

The Mole's cap was missing from its accustomed peg. His goloshes, which always lay by the umbrella-stand, were also gone.

The Rat left the house, and cIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedarefully examined the muddy surface of the ground outside, hoping to find the Mole's tracks. There they were, sure enough. The goloshes were new, just bought for the winter, and the pimples on their soles were fresh and sharp. He could see the imprints of them in the mud, running along straight and purposeful, leading direct to the Wild Wood.

The Rat looked very grave, and stood in deep thought for a minute or two. Then he re-entered the house, strapped a belt round his waist, shoved a brace of pistols into it, took up a stout cudgel that stood in a corner of the hall, and set off for the Wild Wood at a smart pace.

It was already getting towards dusk when he reached the first fringe of trees and plunged without hesitation into the wood, looking anxiously on either side for any sign of his friend. Here and there wicked little faces popped out of holes, but vanished immediately at sight of the valorous animal, his pistols, and the great ugly cudgel in his grasp; and the whistling and pattering, which he hIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedad heard quite plainly on his first entry, died away and ceased, and all was very still. He made his way manfully through the length of the wood, to its furthest edge; then, forsaking all paths, he set himself to traverse it, laboriously working over the whole ground, and all the time calling out cheerfully, Â«Moly, Moly, Moly! Where are you? It's me â€“ it's old Rat!Â»

He had patiently hunted through the wood for an hour or more, when at last to his joy he heard a little answering cry. Guiding himself by the sound, he made his way through the gathering darkness to the foot of an old beech tree, with a hole in it, and from out of the hole came a feeble voice, saying Â«Ratty! Is that really you?Â»

The Rat crept into the hollow, and there he found the Mole, exhausted and still trembling. Â«O Rat!Â» he cried, Â«I've been so frightened, you can't think!Â»

Â«O, I quite understandÂ», said the Rat soothingly. Â«You shouldn't really have gone and done it, Mole. I did my best to keep you from it. We river-banIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedkers, we hardly ever come here by ourselves. If we have to come, we come in couples, at least; then we're generally all right. Besides, there are a hundred things one has to know, which we understand all about and you don't, as yet. I mean passwords, and signs, and sayings which have power and effect, and plants you carry in your pocket, and verses you repeat, and dodges and tricks you practise; all simple enough when you know them, but they've got to be known if you're small, or you'll find yourself in trouble. Of course if you were Badger or Otter, it would be quite another matterÂ».

Â«Surely the brave Mr. Toad wouldn't mind coming here by himself, would he?Â» inquired the Mole.

Â«Old Toad?Â» said the Rat, laughing heartily. Â«He wouldn't show his face here alone, not for a whole hatful of golden guineas, Toad wouldn'tÂ».

The Mole was greatly cheered by the sound of the Rat's careless laughter, as well as by the sight of his stick and his gleaming pistols, and he stopped shivering and began to feelIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibited bolder and more himself again.

Â«Now thenÂ», said the Rat presently, Â«we really must pull ourselves together and make a start for home while there's still a little light left. It will never do to spend the night here, you understand. Too cold, for one thingÂ».

Â«Dear RattyÂ», said the poor Mole, Â«I'm dreadfully sorry, but I'm simply dead beat and that's a solid fact. You MUST let me rest here a while longer, and get my strength back, if I'm to get home at allÂ».

Â«O, all rightÂ», said the good-natured Rat, Â«rest away. It's pretty nearly pitch dark now, anyhow; and there ought to be a bit of a moon laterÂ».

So the Mole got well into the dry leaves and stretched himself out, and presently dropped off into sleep, though of a broken and troubled sort; while the Rat covered himself up, too, as best he might, for warmth, and lay patiently waiting, with a pistol in his paw.

When at last the Mole woke up, much refreshed and in his usual spirits, the Rat said, Â«Now then! I'll just take a look outsiIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedde and see if everything's quiet, and then we really must be offÂ».

He went to the entrance of their retreat and put his head out. Then the Mole heard him saying quietly to himself, Â«Hullo! hullo! hereâ€” is â€“ a â€“ go!Â»

Â«What's up, Ratty?Â» asked the Mole.

Â«SNOW is upÂ», replied the Rat briefly; Â«or rather, DOWN. It's snowing hardÂ».

The Mole came and crouched beside him, and, looking out, saw the wood that had been so dreadful to him in quite a changed aspect. Holes, hollows, pools, pitfalls, and other black menaces to the wayfarer were vanishing fast, and a gleaming carpet of faery was springing up everywhere, that looked too delicate to be trodden upon by rough feet. A fine powder filled the air and caressed the cheek with a tingle in its touch, and the black boles of the trees showed up in a light that seemed to come from below.

Â«Well, well, it can't be helpedÂ», said the Rat, after pondering. Â«We must make a start, and take our chance, I suppose. The worst of it is, I don't exactIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedly know where we are. And now this snow makes everything look so very differentÂ».

It did indeed. The Mole would not have known that it was the same wood. However, they set out bravely, and took the line that seemed most promising, holding on to each other and pretending with invincible cheerfulness that they recognized an old friend in every fresh tree that grimly and silently greeted them, or saw openings, gaps, or paths with a familiar turn in them, in the monotony of white space and black tree-trunks that refused to vary.

An hour or two later â€“ they had lost all count of time â€“ they pulled up, dispirited, weary, and hopelessly at sea, and sat down on a fallen tree-trunk to recover their breath and consider what was to be done. They were aching with fatigue and bruised with tumbles; they had fallen into several holes and got wet through; the snow was getting so deep that they could hardly drag their little legs through it, and the trees were thicker and more like each other than ever. There seemeIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedd to be no end to this wood, and no beginning, and no difference in it, and, worst of all, no way out.

Â«We can't sit here very longÂ», said the Rat. Â«We shall have to make another push for it, and do something or other. The cold is too awful for anything, and the snow will soon be too deep for us to wade throughÂ». He peered about him and considered. Â«Look hereÂ», he went on, Â«this is what occurs to me. There's a sort of dell down here in front of us, where the ground seems all hilly and humpy and hummocky. We'll make our way down into that, and try and find some sort of shelter, a cave or hole with a dry floor to it, out of the snow and the wind, and there we'll have a good rest before we try again, for we're both of us pretty dead beat. Besides, the snow may leave off, or something may turn upÂ».

So once more they got on their feet, and struggled down into the dell, where they hunted about for a cave or some corner that was dry and a protection from the keen wind and the whirling snow. They were iIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitednvestigating one of the hummocky bits the Rat had spoken of, when suddenly the Mole tripped up and fell forward on his face with a squeal.

Â«O my leg!Â» he cried. Â«O my poor shin!Â» and he sat up on the snow and nursed his leg in both his front paws.

Â«Poor old Mole!Â» said the Rat kindly. Â«You don't seem to be having much luck to-day, do you? Let's have a look at the leg. YesÂ», he went on, going down on his knees to look, Â«you've cut your shin, sure enough. Wait till I get at my handkerchief, and I'll tie it up for youÂ».

Â«I must have tripped over a hidden branch or a stumpÂ», said the Mole miserably. Â«O, my! O, my!Â»

Â«It's a very clean cutÂ», said the Rat, examining it again attentively. Â«That was never done by a branch or a stump. Looks as if it was made by a sharp edge of something in metal. Funny!Â» He pondered awhile, and examined the humps and slopes that surrounded them.

Â«Well, never mind what done itÂ», said the Mole, forgetting his grammar in his pain. Â«It hurts just the samIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitede, whatever done itÂ».

But the Rat, after carefully tying up the leg with his handkerchief, had left him and was busy scraping in the snow. He scratched and shovelled and explored, all four legs working busily, while the Mole waited impatiently, remarking at intervals, Â«O, COME on, Rat!Â»

Suddenly the Rat cried Â«Hooray!Â» and then Â«Hooray-oo-ray-oo-ray-oo-ray!Â» and fell to executing a feeble jig in the snow.

Â«What HAVE you found, Ratty?Â» asked the Mole, still nursing his leg.

Â«Come and see!Â» said the delighted Rat, as he jigged on.

The Mole hobbled up to the spot and had a good look.

Â«WellÂ», he said at last, slowly, Â«I SEE it right enough. Seen the same sort of thing before, lots of times. Familiar object, I call it. A door-scraper! Well, what of it? Why dance jigs around a door-scraper?Â»

Â«But don't you see what it MEANS, you â€“ you dull-witted animal?Â» cried the Rat impatiently.

Â«Of course I see what it meansÂ», replied the Mole. Â«It simply means that some VERY careleIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedss and forgetful person has left his door-scraper lying about in the middle of the Wild Wood, JUST where it's SURE to trip EVERYBODY up. Very thoughtless of him, I call it. When I get home I shall go and complain about it to â€“ to somebody or other, see if I don't!Â»

Â«O, dear! O, dear!Â» cried the Rat, in despair at his obtuseness. Â«Here, stop arguing and come and scrape!Â» And he set to work again and made the snow fly in all directions around him.

After some further toil his efforts were rewarded, and a very shabby door-mat lay exposed to view.

Â«There, what did I tell you?Â» exclaimed the Rat in great triumph.

Â«Absolutely nothing whateverÂ», replied the Mole, with perfect truthfulness. Â«Well nowÂ», he went on, Â«you seem to have found another piece of domestic litter, done for and thrown away, and I suppose you're perfectly happy. Better go ahead and dance your jig round that if you've got to, and get it over, and then perhaps we can go on and not waste any more time over rubbish-heaps. CaIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedn we EAT a doormat? or sleep under a door-mat? Or sit on a door-mat and sledge home over the snow on it, you exasperating rodent?Â»

Â«Do â€“ you â€“ mean â€“ to â€“ sayÂ», cried the excited Rat, Â«that this door-mat doesn't TELL you anything?Â»

Â«Really, RatÂ», said the Mole, quite pettishly, Â«I think we'd had enough of this folly. Who ever heard of a door-mat TELLING anyone anything? They simply don't do it. They are not that sort at all. Door-mats know their placeÂ».

Â«Now look here, you â€“ you thick-headed beastÂ», replied the Rat, really angry, Â«this must stop. Not another word, but scrape â€“ scrape and scratch and dig and hunt round, especially on the sides of the hummocks, if you want to sleep dry and warm to-night, for it's our last chance!Â»

The Rat attacked a snow-bank beside them with ardour, probing with his cudgel everywhere and then digging with fury; and the Mole scraped busily too, more to oblige the Rat than for any other reason, for his opinion was that his friend was getting Introductory fragment, copying is prohibitedlight-headed.

Some ten minutes' hard work, and the point of the Rat's cudgel struck something that sounded hollow. He worked till he could get a paw through and feel; then called the Mole to come and help him. Hard at it went the two animals, till at last the result of their labours stood full in view of the astonished and hitherto incredulous Mole.

In the side of what had seemed to be a snow-bank stood a solid-looking little door, painted a dark green. An iron bell-pull hung by the side, and below it, on a small brass plate, neatly engraved in square capital letters, they could read by the aid of moonlight MR. BADGER.

The Mole fell backwards on the snow from sheer surprise and delight. Â«Rat!Â» he cried in penitence, Â«you're a wonder! A real wonder, that's what you are. I see it all now! You argued it out, step by step, in that wise head of yours, from the very moment that I fell and cut my shin, and you looked at the cut, and at once your majestic mind said to itself, â€˜Door-scraper!' And then yoIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedu turned to and found the very door-scraper that done it! Did you stop there? No. Some people would have been quite satisfied; but not you. Your intellect went on working. â€˜Let me only just find a door-mat,' says you to yourself, â€˜and my theory is proved!' And of course you found your door-mat. You're so clever, I believe you could find anything you liked. â€˜Now,' says you, â€˜that door exists, as plain as if I saw it. There's nothing else remains to be done but to find it!' Well, I've read about that sort of thing in books, but I've never come across it before in real life. You ought to go where you'll be properly appreciated. You're simply wasted here, among us fellows. If I only had your head, Ratty..Â».

Â«But as you haven'tÂ», interrupted the Rat, rather unkindly, Â«I suppose you're going to sit on the snow all night and TALK. Get up at once and hang on to that bell-pull you see there, and ring hard, as hard as you can, while I hammer!Â»

While the Rat attacked the door with his stick, the Mole Introductory fragment, copying is prohibitedsprang up at the bell-pull, clutched it and swung there, both feet well off the ground, and from quite a long way off they could faintly hear a deep-toned bell respond.




IV.Â Mr. Badger


THEY waited patiently for what seemed a very long time, stamping in the snow to keep their feet warm. At last they heard the sound of slow shuflling footsteps approaching the door from the inside. It seemed, as the Mole remarked to the Rat, like some one walking in carpet slippers that were too large for him and down at heel; which was intelligent of Mole, because that was exactly what it was.

There was the noise of a bolt shot back, and the door opened a few inches, enough to show a long snout and a pair of sleepy blinking eyes.

Â«Now, the VERY next time this happensÂ», said a gruff and suspicious voice, Â«I shall be exceedingly angry. Who is it THIS time, disturbing people on such a night? Speak up!Â»

Â«Oh, BadgerÂ», cried the Rat, Â«let us in, please. It's me, Rat, and my friend Mole, and we've lost ouIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedr way in the snowÂ».

Â«What, Ratty, my dear little man!Â» exclaimed the Badger, in quite a different voice. Â«Come along in, both of you, at once. Why, you must be perished. Well I never! Lost in the snow! And in the Wild Wood, too, and at this time of night! But come in with youÂ».

The two animals tumbled over each other in their eagerness to get inside, and heard the door shut behind them with great joy and relief.

The Badger, who wore a long dressing-gown, and whose slippers were indeed very down at heel, carried a flat candlestick in his paw and had probably been on his way to bed when their summons sounded. He looked kindly down on them and patted both their heads. Â«This is not the sort of night for small animals to be outÂ», he said paternally. Â«I'm afraid you've been up to some of your pranks again, Ratty. But come along; come into the kitchen. There's a first-rate fire there, and supper and everythingÂ».

He shuffled on in front of them, carrying the light, and they followed him, nudging Introductory fragment, copying is prohibitedeach other in an anticipating sort of way, down a long, gloomy, and, to tell the truth, decidedly shabby passage, into a sort of a central hall; out of which they could dimly see other long tunnel-like passages branching, passages mysterious and without apparent end. But there were doors in the hall as well â€“ stout oaken comfortable-looking doors. One of these the Badger flung open, and at once they found themselves in all the glow and warmth of a large fire-lit kitchen.

The floor was well-worn red brick, and on the wide hearth burnt a fire of logs, between two attractive chimney-corners tucked away in the wall, well out of any suspicion of draught. A couple of high-backed settles, facing each other on either side of the fire, gave further sitting accommodations for the sociably disposed. In the middle of the room stood a long table of plain boards placed on trestles, with benches down each side. At one end of it, where an arm-chair stood pushed back, were spread the remains of the Badger's plain but ampIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedle supper. Rows of spotless plates winked from the shelves of the dresser at the far end of the room, and from the rafters overhead hung hams, bundles of dried herbs, nets of onions, and baskets of eggs. It seemed a place where heroes could fitly feast after victory, where weary harvesters could line up in scores along the table and keep their Harvest Home with mirth and song, or where two or three friends of simple tastes could sit about as they pleased and eat and smoke and talk in comfort and contentment. The ruddy brick floor smiled up at the smoky ceiling; the oaken settles, shiny with long wear, exchanged cheerful glances with each other; plates on the dresser grinned at pots on the shelf, and the merry firelight flickered and played over everything without distinction.

The kindly Badger thrust them down on a settle to toast themselves at the fire, and bade them remove their wet coats and boots. Then he fetched them dressing-gowns and slippers, and himself bathed the Mole's shin with warm water and mIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedended the cut with sticking-plaster till the whole thing was just as good as new, if not better. In the embracing light and warmth, warm and dry at last, with weary legs propped up in front of them, and a suggestive clink of plates being arranged on the table behind, it seemed to the storm-driven animals, now in safe anchorage, that the cold and trackless Wild Wood just left outside was miles and miles away, and all that they had suffered in it a half-forgotten dream.

When at last they were thoroughly toasted, the Badger summoned them to the table, where he had been busy laying a repast.[5 - When at last they were thoroughly toasted, the Badger summoned them to the table, where he had been busy laying a repast.Â â€“ ĞšĞ¾Ğ³Ğ´Ğ° Ğ¾Ğ½Ğ¸ Ğ¾ĞºĞ¾Ğ½Ñ‡Ğ°Ñ‚ĞµĞ»ÑŒĞ½Ğ¾ ÑĞ¾Ğ³Ñ€ĞµĞ»Ğ¸ÑÑŒ, Ğ‘Ğ°Ñ€ÑÑƒĞº, ĞºĞ¾Ñ‚Ğ¾Ñ€Ñ‹Ğ¹ Ğ±Ñ‹Ğ» Ğ·Ğ°Ğ½ÑÑ‚ Ñ‚ĞµĞ¼, Ñ‡Ñ‚Ğ¾ Ğ½Ğ°ĞºÑ€Ñ‹Ğ²Ğ°Ğ» Ğ½Ğ° ÑÑ‚Ğ¾Ğ», Ğ¿Ğ¾Ğ·Ğ²Ğ°Ğ» Ğ¸Ñ… ĞµÑÑ‚ÑŒ.] They had felt pretty hungry before, but when they actually saw at last the supper that was spread for them, rIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedeally it seemed only a question of what they should attack first where all was so attractive, and whether the other things would obligingly wait for them till they had time to give them attention. Conversation was impossible for a long time; and when it was slowly resumed, it was that regrettable sort of conversation that results from talking with your mouth full. The Badger did not mind that sort of thing at all, nor did he take any notice of elbows on the table, or everybody speaking at once. As he did not go into Society himself, he had got an idea that these things belonged to the things that didn't really matter. (We know of course that he was wrong, and took too narrow a view; because they do matter very much, though it would take too long to explain why.) He sat in his arm-chair at the head of the table, and nodded gravely at intervals as the animals told their story; and he did not seem surprised or shocked at anything, and he never said, Â«I told you soÂ», or, Â«Just what I always saidÂ», or remarkedIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibited that they ought to have done so-and-so, or ought not to have done something else. The Mole began to feel very friendly towards him.

When supper was really finished at last, and each animal felt that his skin was now as tight as was decently safe, and that by this time he didn't care a hang for anybody or anything, they gathered round the glowing embers of the great wood fire, and thought how jolly it was to be sitting up SO late, and SO independent, and SO full; and after they had chatted for a time about things in general, the Badger said heartily, Â«Now then! tell us the news from your part of the world. How's old Toad going on?Â»

Â«Oh, from bad to worseÂ», said the Rat gravely, while the Mole, cocked up on a settle and basking in the firelight, his heels higher than his head, tried to look properly mournful. Â«Another smash-up only last week, and a bad one. You see, he will insist on driving himself, and he's hopelessly incapable. If he'd only employ a decent, steady, well-trained animal, pay him goIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibitedod wages, and leave everything to him, he'd get on all right. But no; he's convinced he's a heaven-born driver, and nobody can teach him anything; and all the rest followsÂ».

Â«How many has he had?Â» inquired the Badger gloomily.

Â«Smashes, or machines?Â» asked the Rat. Â«Oh, well, after all, it's the same thing â€“ with Toad. This is the seventh. As for the others â€“ you know that coach-house of his? Well, it's piled up â€“ literally piled up to the roof â€“ with fragments of motor-cars, none of them bigger than your hat! That accounts for the other six â€“ so far as they can be accounted forÂ».

Â«He's been in hospital three timesÂ», put in the Mole; Â«and as for the fines he's had to pay, it's simply awful to think ofÂ».

Â«Yes, and that's part of the troubleÂ», continued the Rat. Â«Toad's rich, we all know; but he's not a millionaire. And he's a hopelessly bad driver, and quite regardless of law and order. Killed or ruined â€“ it's got to be one of the two things, sooner or later. Badger! we'reIntroductory fragment, copying is prohibited his friends â€“ oughtn't we to do something?Â»

The Badger went through a bit of hard thinking. Â«Now look here!Â» he said at last, rather severely; Â«of course you know I can't do anything NOW?Â»

His two friends assented, quite understanding his point. No animal, according to the rules of animal-etiquette, is ever expected to do anything strenuous, or heroic, or even moderately active during the off-season of winter. All are sleepy â€“ some actually asleep. All are weather-bound, more or less; and all are resting from arduous days and nights, during which every muscle in them has been severely tested, and every energy kept at full stretch.

Â«Very well then!Â» continued the Badger. Â«BUT, when once the year has really turned, and the nights are shorter, and halfway through them one rouses and feels fidgety and wanting to be up and doing by sunrise, if not before â€“ YOU know!..Â».
